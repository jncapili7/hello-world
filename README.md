# hello-world

  Hi, Jupiter here! You read it right. My name is Jupiter, The Big Planet. But I'm not big.
I like coding and solving problems. As a background, I had a very basic crash course on Program Logic Formulation and
Structured C++ (using a Turbo C++) a long time ago.. Now. here I am, interested in coding again.
